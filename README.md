2. Expected List of Features
A simple, easy to remember URL- This is of utmost importance. The URL can be the life or death of your online stance. We happen to know that making the URL simple and marketable is best practice. So, with that being said, our team will research the best fit for your company and make sure the “internet road” leads straight to your doorstep.
A Clear Description of your Business- First impressions! How many times have we heard that one before? This will showcase your business mission statement, why you are here, and what benefits you can bring to your customers life. 
Call to Actions-                                                                                                    “Having a website is good. Getting people to that website is better. But getting those visitors to convert into actual purchases or leads is really what matters in the big picture.”                                                  ~ globalreach.com ~                                                                                   We will create call to action on the page, whether it be making purchases, submitting a contact form, or even subscribing to your newsletter. 
Contact Information- Built into the footer of your website, and also treated as its own living page. This living page will also feature contact forms and inquiry forms. 
Mobile Friendly/Responsive Design- We all use our cell phones the majority of the time so this perk will allow your website to display nicely on smaller screens. It can also help give an edge on search rankings! 
Bio page-  This is where your personal stories and photos live. Who doesn’t want to know the person behind the curtain?         Having this feature is also invaluable. Bringing your customers in and telling them who you are will benefit the organization in many ways.  
Vendor Application Page- No one wants to be alone, so with this feature you can recruit other vendors with the same mission as you to team up and really get the community feel on your website!                                            
3. Market Survey
Custom Botanicals Dispensary - The interactive design is pretty awesome on this site. When you scale to a smaller viewport, the hamburger and search bar come up to help the user navigate in the small space.
Green Planet Apothecary- WOW! This site has everything! Which is good and bad. Too much clutter in a room will drive people out quickly.
Love Your Mother Apothecary - This one is a perfect example of a URL that is way too long. Looks like the website isn’t quite finished yet, or under construction. The name is very humorous and catchy though.
7 Feathers Apothecary- This site is absolutely beautiful upon entering, featuring a pop-out form (perfect to gather data) and give the customer something invaluable to them in return. This is a great way to build credit with new customers when they land on your site. 
Runs with Wolves Apothecary- This site is set up well! The name is super catchy and marketable. Their call to action set up is pretty cool. The colors are very calming and the photos on the site are very easy on the eyes!
